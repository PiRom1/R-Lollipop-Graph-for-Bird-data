# R-Lollipop-Graph-for-Bird-data
Beautiful lollipop graph with ggplot2, showing abundance of several oak relative birds according to the presence of boar pens or not 

This script will show you some ggplot2 command, in order to draw a Lollipop graph. 

There are two versions of thi graph, one is more colored than the other. 

/!\ : You juste have to change the first line (setwd (...) ), and use your pathway to rush the .xlsx files. 

Enjoy !
